With things moving as quickly as they do now in the housing market, you need a loan officer who will communicate with you quickly and efficiently. When I was going back and forth between buying and building, Christina gave me information and figures to compare. When I needed to know if I could afford a property that has a higher HOA and taxes, she had numbers for me before I even made it home! When I needed a pre-approval letter, now she had it ready! I have been continually impressed<br> with her ability to go above and beyond my expectations. You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better loan officer in your corner than Christina!&quot;</strong></p>

Christina has handled 4 loans for my husband and I. All future loans will go through her as well. Her attention to detail, her followup and her caring personality are all topnotch. I always feel Christina is looking out for our best interests. She is always so good at explaining the process and keeping us informed. She knows her business inside and out and I find that very comforting, Thank you Christina for all of your help over the last 17 years!&quot;</strong></p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Meet Christina</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-light">Since 1999, Christina has been providing mortgage solutions for her clients in both Virginia and Georgia where she holds her state licenses.  She has stayed in this industry for so long because she loves helping people make their own HOMES- in this way she feels like she is a valuable part of her community.  She lives in Bedford County  with her family and enjoys reading, traveling, and hanging out with her fur babies, one of which is a paralyzed French bulldog named Archie.  "Taking care of Archie since his injury feels alot like it did when my 3 boys were just babies--- the diapers and constant care.  But it is all worth it when he looks at me with his big puppy dog eyes!" she says.</p>
